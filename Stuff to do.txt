1. Fix Search by image size
2. Refractoring the code? (Do this the last)


Problems :
- Apparently, using dhtmlxgrid is really limited; You can't automatically convert cm/inch, and you can't upload the
image directly to the database. It might be better to create the database manager from scratch.

- Trying to see if I can add in any transition effect between pictures.

- Any other important functions?
