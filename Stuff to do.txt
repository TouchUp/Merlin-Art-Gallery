1. Fix Search by image size

Problems :
- Trying to see if I can add in any transition effect between pictures.

- SANITIZE INPUTS!!

- Increase height of black box and make it autoscroll

- Add a scrolling speed option

- Have the option to SAVE transition selections somehow so that people don’t have to select the same thing over and over again
