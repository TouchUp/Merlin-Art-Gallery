1. Fix Search by image size

Problems :
- Apparently, using dhtmlxgrid is really limited; You can't automatically convert cm/inch, and you can't upload the
image directly to the database. It might be better to create the database manager from scratch.

- Trying to see if I can add in any transition effect between pictures.

- Upload dialog should be graphical, no typing in path names

- SANITIZE INPUTS!!

- Increase height of black box and make it autoscroll

- Have the ability to add categories in DHTMLX database manager (add column)

- Add a scrolling speed option

- New SQL categories:
	- Artist DOB (Y M D in separate fields)
	- Media (oil, watercolour, etc)
	- Subject (scenery, impressionist)
	- Location of painting
	- Painting year
	- Country of origin of artist
	- For media, do a text + dropdown hybrid input 
	- For subject, do a text + dropdown hybrid input

- Have the option to SAVE transition selections somehow so that people don’t have to select the same thing over and over again
